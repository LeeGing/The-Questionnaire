# The Questionnaire

### A Vue.JS Project

The purpose of this project was to become familiar with Vue.JS and creating my own templates. 

## Description:

The Questionnaire is a web application that provides questionnaires for users to answer. 

These questionnaires may be used for a variety of purposes. 

Each questionnaire records the users answers to determine the outcome.

The advertisements shown are dependent on the outcome.

## 3 Types of Questionnaires

1. True/False Questionnaire - Career Questions - suggests whether users would enjoy being a lumberjack. 
2. Multiple Choice Questionnaire - Activity Questions - helps users decide what activities to do for the day.
3. Dropdown Menu Questionnaires - Networking Questions - suggests events and clubs for users.
